# TAO/LaSalle rules

Note: I sometimes use `*` as a wildcard in the IPA because some rules assume skipping a vowel : journal `JOURBL` (IPA `ʒuʁnal`), fournil `FOURBL` (IPA `fuʁnil`))

Note: I sometimes use `~` in IPA because some rules are relevant for all nasal vowels. If confused, ask me.

Note: I commented some rules with `TODO:`. It's not always things to do, but that allowed for a consistent way to add comments from me when a rule wasn't clear, or there is some thinking to do, etc.

## General rules


The star in a chord is used to distinguish verbs and nouns that are homophones. Starred chords are verbs. (TODO: Verify that. Is it always the case? The examples in this particular lesson aren't very telling.)

The star is used for capitalised nouns ("Rose" vs "rose", "Fleur" vs "fleur"...).

The number bar works exactly like Plover theory

The star is used to cancel the last chord in case of a mistake

The middle "i" can be omitted in several words (édifice `DWIS`, rapide `RAPD`, formidable `FORM/DABL`)

To speed things up, it is possible to do groupings while inverting `-Z` (sa), `OZ` (son), `EZ` (ses), `ESZ` (ces).

The `AI` keys in a separate chord are used to distinguish between first group verbs in the past tense and homophones (tirait `TIR/S`, tiret `TIR/AI`, filait `FIL/-S`, filet `FIL/AI`)

We don't write the "e" in the body of a word (relevé `R-L/VE`, degré `D-G/R*E`)

When "ré" is a suffix, we add a star

"s'est" is written `*Z` in groupings (elle s'est `L*Z`)

Key `H` designates the "n" in a negation (ne `H-`, n'est pas `HEPS`, ni `HI`, ne le `H-L`, n'est plus `HEP`)

The `Y` is used to represent the pronoun "il" (il a `YA`, il est `Y-Z`, il a les `YALS`, il a été `YAET`)

When a proper noun is ended with the letter "Y", write `AO*E` in a separate chord.

When a word ends in "ette", write `*T` in a separate chord.

When a consonant is doubled, it is possible to skip a stroke (TODO: What?)

To avoid moving hands to get to the numbers bar, numbers can all be written phonetically.

When "100" isn't multiplied, write `SUN`. Otherwise, write `S-N` for when you hear "cent" (IPA `sɑ̃`)(100).

When "mille" (1000) isn't multiplied, write `PHRIL`. When "mille" is multiplied and followed by three zeros, write `WR-RB`.

TODO: Fingerspelling and punctuation is different than it is in Plover theory, and explained in lesson 20 of the book. Maybe see if we can't use Plover theory for those?

The `-FRBGS` chord is used to remove spaces before and after a comma.

The `-RPBGS` chord is used to remove spaces before and after a period.

Key `-G` is used for the "en" preposition in groupings.

Keys `KOEN` designate the "con" prefix

Keys `STK` (`SD`) designate words beginning with "dés" and "déc" when followed with a vowel. TODO: This is maybe phonetic. It should be with "déc", "déc", "déç", "dec", "des", maybe "det" in some cases

Keys `DAOE` designate words starting with "dé" (see lesson 56) TODO: This might be phonetic as well. Inspect examples and lesson 56.

It is possible to eliminate an `S` when it's immediately followed by a consonant.

When two consonnants ending a word are in the reverse order relative to the keyboard, we either reverse the order of those letters, or we write the last consonant on the right hand.

The `-FR` chord in front of `-BGS` (`X`) becomes an "n".

The word "ça" can be written in two ways: `SHA` and `-SZ` TODO: Used in groupings like "c'est ça" `S-SZ` or "ça va" `SHAFZ`

The `-D` key/chord designates past participles. TODO: This might be a hard one, those take different forms.

The "s" in front of a "c" or a "p" can be omitted.

Key `-G` designates the word "en" (in groupings like "on en" `OG`, "t'en" `T-G`, "elle en" `L-G`)

Key `*` is used to distinguish endings in "ou" ("mate ou" `MAT/OU`, "matou" `MAT/O*U`, "cour ou" `KOUR/OU`, "courroux" `KOUR/O*U`)

Key `*` is used to distinguish nouns from names (or common nouns from proper nouns)


## Specific rules


The `*UT` code is used in the interrogative form ("Parles-tu", "fais-tu", etc)

The `-Z`, when hit alone, means "est" ("il est")

The `H-` key can be used for "il" when there are groupings.

Keys `KP` (`X`) also designate "que ce". (Briefs)

Keys `KWA` designate "il y a"

Keys `SWA` designate "s'il a"

Keys `SKWA` designate "s'il y a"

Keys `SKWHR` designate "je le"

Keys `STK` (`SD`) designate the word "des".


## Rules I'm deducing from examples

- Keys `EFS` indicate the "ez-vous" ending (second person plural, present tense, interrogative form). TODO: This might just be natural, as the simple combination of the sound `E` and `-FS` being "vous"
- Keys `AEFS` indicate the "iez-vous" ending (second person plural, past tense, interrogative form) TODO: This might just be natural, as the simple combination of the sound `AE` and `-FS` being "vous"


## Missing from the theory?

- While `-S` in a separate chord indicates the "ait" ending for the past tense, third person singular, I didn't see a way to write "ais" (same tense, second person singular). `-SZ` could work, but barring any conflicts I think it would make more sense to use `-T` for "ait" and `-S` for "ais". `-NS` could also be use for "aient" (which has no phonetic difference). "ai" is another one, which could simply be `AOE`, since that's the stroke for that sound to begin with. Looking at the book, lesson 32, conjugations of "être" and "pouvoir", the theory seems to rely on grouping verbs with their pronouns to deduce verb endings: "j'étais" `JETS`, "il était" `YETS`. This would make the dictionary much bigger because it would require every verb to exist *with* the pronouns in the conjugated form.


- While `-D` is used to indicate a past participle, there's no way (in the book at least) to "match it" (don't know the actual word) with the subject. "allé" would be `ALD`, but there's no way to write "allés" (plural), "allée" (fem.) or "allées" (fem. plural). Since the `E` key isn't used for past principles, "allée" could be `ALED`, "allés" `ALSD` and "allées" `ALESD`. It's all a bit backwards relative to the steno order but using those as rules could make sense.
